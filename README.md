# WebScraper
Created a WebScraper that collects apartment data such as sqft, bedrooms, neighborhood, and more from craigslist and analyzes that data form it. It also can help you find apartments that fit specific parameters that you want. 
Just run the program and it will automatically scrape as many posts for apartments in minneapolis as it can. 
On line 80, you can change the paramater so you find specific apartments that meet your criteria and get links/ more information to them.
